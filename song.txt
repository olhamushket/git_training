Your sweet insanity is whispering in my ears
And you speak of honesty by lying to yourself
So tell me, do you know any more good stories?
Which role should I play?
And I can be the least of all of your worries
How often can you say
Believe me, I'm so sorry
But the truth is, I'm not a part of your story
